  <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
  <h3>There are may things I like, but a few of those things are my favorites!</h3>
  <body>
        <p>I like life, it's a blessing to mankind by God,</p>
        <p>I love death, it is the only fair thing that can happen to mankind on this planet, <br>people are born in different environment, they grow in varying niches, and one thing has the guts to shower us with its generous blessings, DEATH.</p>
        <p>The fact that we die doesnt warrant laziness, neither does it warrant ignorance, instead,<br> it calls for a proactive mindset, time waits for no king, you are at twnty five, you claim to be broke, <br>but the only logic behind this is that you are poor, addenda to it will be rationality, <br>ehich is largely falliable unless gauged against a standard test.</p>

    <h4>Here is a list of what I think I like</h4>
        <ul>
