  <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
  <h3>There are may things I like, but a few of those things are my favorites!</h3>
  <body>
    <p>I like life, it's a blessing to mankind by God,</p>
    <p>I love death, it is the only fair thing that can happen to mankind on this planet, <br>people are born in different environment, they grow in varying niches, and one thing has the guts to shower us with its generous blessings, DEATH.</p>
    <p>The fact that we die doesnt warrant laziness, neither does it warrant ignorance, instead,<br> it calls for a proactive mindset, time waits for no king, you are at twnty five, you claim to be broke, <br>but the only logic behind this is that you are poor, addenda to it will be rationality, <br>ehich is largely falliable unless gauged against a standard test.</p>

    <h4>Here is a list of what I think I like</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Knowledgew</li>
      <li>Wisdom</li>
      <li>Humility</li>
      <li>Courage</li>
      <li>Bravery</li>
      <li>Leadership</li>
      <p>Politics</p>
      <p>Business</p>
      <p>PEACE & LOGICAL SILENCE!</p>
    </ul>
